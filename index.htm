              The only validation of my personal character came when I asked him what I had done to
              piss them off so badly. He replied, "Dude, you didn't do anything. These are simple
              people who are not worthy of your hatred. You don't belong at a place like Wal-Mart.
              Everyone knows it. One day you will become a famous writer and amass a huge following.
              People will adore you and look at you as an influence for themselves and their children.
              Statues will be erected in your honor. A car will be named after you. You will be able
              to transmute lead into gold, and you will evolve into pure energy and understand the
              true nature of God." Or something like thatâ€”because he asked not to be named, he can't
              refute the quote.

          <h3>LOGCAP (Logistics Civil Augmentation Program)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created in 1985 to privatize more of the duties involved in civil logistics in the military.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later, Dick Cheny, as defense secretary in 1992, spearheaded a movement to privatize
              most of the military's civil logistics activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Under his direction, Pentagon paid $9 million to Halliburton/KBR to conduct a study to
              determine whether private companies like itself should handle all of the military's
              civil logistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              KBR's classified study concluded that greater privatization of logistics was in the
              government's best interest. Shortly after, on Aug 3, 1992, Cheney awarded the first
              comprehensive LOGCAP contract to KBR.
            </li>
            <li>
              3 years later, Halliburton hired Cheney as CEO
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1997, two years after Cheney became CEO of Halliburton, KBR's LOGCAP contract was
              not renewed; the government alleged the company engaged in fraudulent billing practices.
            </li>
            <li>
            <li>
              The independent auditing arm of Congress, the GAO, criticized KBR's performance during
              America's war in the Balkans. KBR's cost-overruns in the Balkans inflated the original
              contract price by 32%.
            </li>
            <li>
              After KBR was fired by the Army in 1997, the LOGCAP contract was awarded to
              Halliburton competitor DynCorp. But after Cheney became Vice President in 2001,
              DynCorp was fired and KBR was re-awarded the contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Halliburton revenue from LOGCAP increased from $320 million in 2nd quarter of 2003 to
              over $2 billion in fourth quarter of 2003.
            </li>
            <li>
              As of May 2004, the federal government had spent nearly $5 billion on LOGCAP since KBR
              became the sole contractor in 2001.
            </li>
            <li>
              The original value of LOGCAP in Iraq was estimated at over $4 billion, but the value
              of the contract is now over $8 billion. $8 billion figure for Iraq does not include
              KBR's LOGCAP business in dozens of other countries around the globe, including
              Guantanimo Bay, Cuba, where it constructed the prison facilities.
